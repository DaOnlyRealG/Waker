# Waker
Your New Wake Up Alarm


⚠️ This is still in work ⚠️

This project will come with its own hardware.

✱ You can download all the files and all you have to do is to configure the wake up alarm in the main.js file, here you can chose to show the darkmode switch, to show the icons(not looking good rn) and to chose your loacation, which is located in assets, then js.

✱ You can also have you own background and for this uou have to replace the file background.jpg in assets → css.

✱ You can activate the darkmode by pressing the enter key.

✱ The future features will be, the alarm, the automatic darkmode, and a more easy way to configure the whole project.![WakerLogo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109428858/179373641-0da9e901-bb06-4ee4-be89-ab71996dee43.png)
